Here is an improved version of the paragraph:

Welcome to the 5.3.1-beta version of the MINA Overwatch Server Selector! Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new:

âš« The NA EAST option has been removed due to the server no longer existing in-game.
âš« A new NA Central option has been added.
âš« NA West is no longer linked with NA Central.
âš« A new messaging feature has been implemented, allowing me to send messages like this one to keep you updated or report any issues.

ðŸŸ¡ Please note that this is a BETA version under development. Use with caution and consider using Quick Play to test the stability of this version.

Donâ€™t forget to report any issues you encounter on our Discord server. Thank you for your support!
