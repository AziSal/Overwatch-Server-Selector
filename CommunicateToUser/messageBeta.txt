Welcome to the 5.3.1-beta build 1.1 version of the MINA Overwatch Server Selector! Here’s what’s new:


Added features:
- The NA EAST option has been removed due to the server no longer existing in-game.
- A new NA Central option has been added.
- NA West is no longer linked with NA Central.
- A new messaging feature has been implemented, allowing me to send messages like this one to keep you updated or report any issues.

Fixed on build 1.1
- NA Central button was stuck on " Working on it ".
- Added troubleshooting debugs to log such issues.

Please note that this is a BETA version under development. Use with caution and consider using Quick Play to test the stability of this version.

Don’t forget to report any issues you encounter on our Discord server. Thank you for your support!
