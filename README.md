## Introduction

The application simply works by blocking Overwatch 2 IP addresses using wf.msc (Firewall with Advance Security). To do this, the application needs to run as administrator. It uses Component Object Model (COM) API to directly add/remove the blocking rules. **The application does not read or write on game files or modify the network traffic of the game!**

As long as you have a standard firewall (Windows Firewall) and antivirus (Microsoft Defender Antivirus), no further action to make the application work is necessary.

There are predefined buttons to block the server regions AU, EU, ME, NA-West, and NA-East. You can also use the "Custom" button to selectively block regions/servers.

The Overwatch 2 matchmaker will test to find the best server with the best ping. When you block a server in the firewall, the specified server will be inaccessible and get ranked lowest amongst the server. The server with the lowest ping will be selected and used to find you a game.

The block ME option can help in a situation where some times the matchmaker puts you in a bad server, for example if your best is EU, it gets you to ME one game out of 100.

EU players can, with this application, now play on NA servers. The problem is that even if you change the Battle.net region to America, it gives you an European Overwatch 2 server. The server selector enables you pick the region to play on whether its NA East or NA West. It then blocks the connection to all other regions than NA West/East.

NA players are also able to specify whether they prefer to play on NA East or NA West.
