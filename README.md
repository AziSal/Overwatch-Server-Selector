A simple program allows you to select the server you want to play on.

The program simply works by adding the block remote ip's rules to wf.msc (Firewall with Advance Security).
Existing servers for example EU, ME, NA-West, and NA-East.
If ME is blocked, the match maker of overwatch will test the best ping you have if it is significant it will choose this server for you and search for a game.
Some times the match making gets you in bad server for you, for example if your best is EU, it gets you to ME one game out of 100.

Another issue where some EU players want to play on NA. Even if you change the region it gets you back to EU. The solution is to block EU and ME severs and change the region to NA.
In addtion, some NA players wants to choose from West and East, which will be a feature of the program.
